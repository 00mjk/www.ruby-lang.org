  <p>Pearson Education is running a <a href="http://www.voicesthatmatter.com/ruby2008/">Voices That Matter</a> Ruby conference this fall in Boston.  The conference, from the same people who Addison-Wesley's Professional Ruby Series, will give you a chance to meet and learn from those very same authors.  Don't miss a chance to interact with so many Ruby professionals.</p>

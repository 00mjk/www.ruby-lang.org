  <h3><a href="/en/news/2010/03/26/ruby-summer-of-code-2010/">Ruby Summer of Code 2010</a></h3>

  <p>Continuing in Google’s great tradition of encouraging student open source development, <a href="http://rubycentral.org/">Ruby Central</a>, <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/blog/2010/ruby-summer-of-code-is-here/">Engine Yard</a>, and the <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/3/24/ruby-summer-of-code">Rails core team</a> are teaming up to present the first annual <a href="http://rubysoc.org/">Ruby Summer of Code</a>.</p>


	<p>Head over to <a href="http://rubysoc.org/">rubysoc.org</a> to get started and follow <a href="http://twitter.com/rubysoc">@rubysoc</a> for news.</p>


The summer will follow Google’s example closely:
	<ul>
<li>students are paid a $5000 stipend to work full-time during their summer break</li>
		<li>a group of Ruby gurus volunteer their time as mentors</li>
		<li>mentors vote on student proposals based on usefulness, benefit to the Ruby community, and history of motivated open source contribution</li>
	</ul>
<p>The more we raise, the more students we can fund. <a href="http://rubysoc.org/">Donate now!</a></p>

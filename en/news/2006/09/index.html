  <p>As you can see the much anticipated redesign is now live. It was over a year ago that <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/131284">it was suggested</a> that a &#8220;visual identity team&#8221; be formed for the purpose of redesigning the Ruby Web site. The redesign team created over 20 mockups for the the new site, <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/redesign2005/">posted several</a> for the Ruby community to comment on, and finally decided on the current design.</p>


	<p>Once the design was chosen it was lovingly converted to <span class="caps">CSS</span> and <span class="caps">XHTML</span> and an <a href="http://radiantcms.org">administration system</a> was written for it. The content was then ported over from the old Web site and massaged by an enthusiastic group of volunteers.</p>

title: To Ruby From PHP
---

<p><span class="caps">PHP</span> is in widespread use for web applications, but if you want to use Ruby on Rails
or just want a language that&#8217;s more tailored for general use, Ruby is worth a look.</p>


	<h3>Similarities</h3>


As in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, in Ruby&#8230;
	<ul>
<li>Ruby is dynamically typed, like in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about having to
declare variables.</li>
		<li>There are classes, and you can control access to them like in <span class="caps">PHP 5</span> (<code>public</code>, 
<code>protected</code> and <code>private</code>)</li>
		<li>Some variables start with $, like in <span class="caps">PHP</span> (but not all)</li>
		<li>There&#8217;s <code>eval</code>, too.</li>
		<li>You can use string interpolating. Instead of doing &#8221;$foo is a $bar&#8221;, you can do
&#8221;#{foo} is a #{bar}&#8221;&#8212;like in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, this doesn&#8217;t apply for single-quoted strings.</li>
		<li>There&#8217;s heredocs</li>
		<li>Ruby has exceptions, like <span class="caps">PHP 5</span>
</li>
		<li>There&#8217;s a fairly large standard library</li>
		<li>Arrays and hashes work like expected, if you exchange <code>array()</code> for <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>:
<code>array('a' =&gt; 'b')</code> becomes <code>{'a' =&gt; 'b'}</code>.</li>
		<li>
<code>true</code> and <code>false</code> behave like in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, but <code>null</code> is called <code>nil</code>
</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Differences</h3>


Unlike in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, in Ruby&#8230;
	<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s strong typing. You&#8217;ll need to call <code>to_s</code>, <code>to_i</code> etc. to convert between
strings, integers and so on, instead of relying on the language to do it</li>
		<li>Strings, numbers, arrays, hashes, etc. are objects. Instead of calling abs(-1)
it&#8217;s -1.abs</li>
		<li>Parentheses are optional in method calls, except to clarify which parameters go to
which method calls</li>
		<li>Instead of naming conventions, like underscores, the standard library and extensions
are organized in modules and classes</li>
		<li>Reflection is an inherent capability of objects, you don&#8217;t need to use <code>Reflection</code>
classes like in <span class="caps">PHP 5</span>
</li>
		<li>Variables are references.</li>
		<li>There&#8217;s no <code>abstract</code> classes or <code>interface</code>s</li>
		<li>Hashes and arrays are not interchangeable</li>
		<li>Only <code>false</code> and <code>nil</code> are false: <code>0</code>, <code>array()</code> and <code>""</code> are all true in conditionals.</li>
		<li>Almost everything is a method call, even <code>raise</code> (<code>throw</code> in <span class="caps">PHP</span>).</li>

<p>I wanted to get the word out about the upcoming Tulsa Ruby Workshop.  This will take place on April 26th, from 10 AM to 4 PM in Tulsa, OK.</p>


	<p>The workshop has a great line up of intro Ruby and Rail content.  I&#8217;m honored to have been asked to give two of the talks that day:  an introduction to Ruby talk as well as a Ruby from Java talk.  There will also be a beginning Rails talk from Tulsa.rb&#8217;s commander and chief, an Engine Yard employee on hand sharing deployment advice, as well as other language specific migration talks.</p>


	<p>That&#8217;s pretty much a full day of Ruby learning and the best news is that attendance is free.  They are even throwing in some food.</p>


	<p>If you&#8217;re going to be in the area, definitely come join us!</p>


	<p>You can find directions, a schedule, and other details about the workshop at:</p>

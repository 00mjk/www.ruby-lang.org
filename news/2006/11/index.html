  <h3><a href="/en/news/2006/11/03/CVE-2006-5467/">DoS Vulnerability in CGI Library</a></h3>

  <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the <span class="caps">CGI</span> library (cgi.rb) that ships with Ruby which could be used by a malicious user to create a denial of service attack (DoS). The problem is triggered by sending the library an <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request that uses multipart <span class="caps">MIME</span> encoding and has an invalid boundary specifier that begins with &#8220;-&#8221; instead of &#8220;--&#8221;. Once triggered it will exhaust all available memory resources effectively creating a DoS condition.</p>


	<p><strong>Ruby 1.8.5 and all prior versions are vulnerable.</strong> This vulnerability is open to the public as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5467"><span class="caps">CVE</span>-2006-5467</a>.</p>

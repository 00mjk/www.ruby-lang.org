  <p>We have moved the source code repository to <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/">http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/</a>.
You can checkout it using the svn command, or you can also browse it by <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?root=ruby">ViewVC</a>.</p>
<p>The new machine for svn.ruby-lang.org is provided by <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.
We are using <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris 10</a> on the new machine, and it works pretty well.</p>

  <h3><a href="/en/news/2006/12/04/another-dos-vulnerability-in-cgi-library/">Another DoS Vulnerability in <span class="caps">CGI</span> Library</a></h3>

  <p>Another vulnerability has been discovered in the <span class="caps">CGI</span> library (cgi.rb)
that ships with Ruby which could be used by a malicious user to
create a denial of service attack (DoS).</p>
<p>This vulnerability is open to the public as
<a href="http://jvn.jp/jp/JVN%2384798830/index.html"><span class="caps">JVN</span>#84798830</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that the previous patch
(<a href="http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.5-cgi-dos-1.patch">&lt;URL:http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.5-cgi-dos-1.patch&gt;</a>)

  <h3><a href="/en/news/2006/11/03/CVE-2006-5467/">DoS Vulnerability in <span class="caps">CGI</span> Library</a></h3>

  <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CGI</span></span> library (cgi.rb) that ships with Ruby which could be used by a malicious user to create a denial of service attack (DoS). The problem is triggered by sending the library an <span class="caps"><span class="caps">HTTP</span></span> request that uses multipart <span class="caps"><span class="caps">MIME</span></span> encoding and has an invalid boundary specifier that begins with &#8220;<del>&#8221; instead of &#8220;</del>-&#8221;. Once triggered it will exhaust all available memory resources effectively creating a DoS condition.</p>

    <p><strong>Ruby 1.8.5 and all prior versions are vulnerable.</strong> This vulnerability is open to the public as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5467"><span class="caps"><span class="caps">CVE</span></span>-2006-5467</a>.</p>

  <h3><a href="/en/news/2006/10/26/rubyconf-2006-recap/">RubyConf 2006 Recap</a></h3>

  <p>Last weekend over 300 Rubyists gathered in Denver, CO to discuss many aspects of our favorite language.  This was my first conference and I must say they are every bit as impressive as you have probably heard.  The presentations are great, but it&#8217;s hard to top talking and hacking with with fellow Rubyists between the events.  Everyone should experience that at least once.</p>

  <h3><a href="/en/news/2006/09/12/site-launch-at-last/">Site Launch At Last!</a></h3>

  <p>As you can see the much anticipated redesign is now live. It was over a year ago that <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/131284">it was suggested</a> that a &#8220;visual identity team&#8221; be formed for the purpose of redesigning the Ruby Web site. The redesign team created over 20 mockups for the the new site, <a href="http://redhanded.hobix.com/redesign2005/">posted several</a> for the Ruby community to comment on, and finally decided on the current design.</p>

    <p>Once the design was chosen it was lovingly converted to <span class="caps"><span class="caps">CSS</span></span> and <span class="caps"><span class="caps">XHTML</span></span> and an <a href="http://radiantcms.org">administration system</a> was written for it. The content was then ported over from the old Web site and massaged by an enthusiastic group of volunteers.</p>

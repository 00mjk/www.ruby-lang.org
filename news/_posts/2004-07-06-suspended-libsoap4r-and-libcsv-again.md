title: suspended lib/soap4r and lib/csv again
---

Anonymous <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository for csv(lib/csv) and
soap4r(lib/soap4r) were once released to public at 2004-07-05 15:30:00
<span class="caps">JST</span>(2004-07-05 06:30:00 <span
class="caps">UTC</span>). But I, the maintainer of these repository,
found my checking process of <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository
was not enough. So I suspended the repositories again. Users who
checkout these repositories from 2004-07-05 15:30:00 <acronym
title=\"2004-07-05 06:30:00 &lt;span class=\" caps>UTC\"&gt;JST to
2004-07-06 16:30:00 <acronym title=\"2004-07-06 07:30:00 &lt;span
class=\" caps>UTC\"&gt;JST must check your <span class="caps">CVS</span>
workspace. I’m sorry for the trouble this error caused you. I’ll report
again after confirmation of these repositories. csv and soap libraries
which are bundled to ruby’s repository(/src/ruby) were confirmed that it
is safe.

  <p>A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability was found on the BigDecimal
standard library of Ruby.  Conversion from BigDecimal objects into
Float numbers had a problem which enables attackers to effectively
cause segmentation faults.</p>
<p>ActiveRecord relies on this method, so most Rails applications are
affected by this.  Though this is not a Rails-specific issue.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.approximity.com/cgi-bin/europeRuby/tiki.cgi?c=v&amp;p=Euruko05">EuRuKo 2005</a>, the European Ruby Conference, will be in Munich, Germany, October 15 and 16, 2005.  
If you have any means whatsoever to attend, go.  It is still fairly small, and the intimate feeling of the conference is something special.
You can see the current agenda <a href="http://www.approximity.com/cgi-bin/europeRuby/tiki.cgi?c=v&amp;p=Euruko05AgendaDetail">here</a>, but last year there were assorted spontaneous talks and discussions as well and it will likely be the same this year.</p>

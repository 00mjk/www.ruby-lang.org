  <h3><a href="/en/news/2004/07/06/suspended-libsoap4r-and-libcsv-again/">suspended lib/soap4r and lib/csv again</a></h3>

  <p>Anonymous <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository for csv(lib/csv) and soap4r(lib/soap4r)
were once released to public at 2004-07-05 15:30:00 <span class="caps">JST</span>(2004-07-05
06:30:00 <span class="caps">UTC</span>).  But I, the maintainer of these repository, found my
checking process of <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository was not enough.  So I suspended the
repositories again.  Users who checkout these repositories from
2004-07-05 15:30:00 <acronym title="2004-07-05 06:30:00 &lt;span class=" caps>UTC"&gt;JST</acronym> to 2004-07-06 16:30:00
<acronym title="2004-07-06 07:30:00 &lt;span class=" caps>UTC"&gt;JST</acronym> must check your <span class="caps">CVS</span> workspace.   I&#8217;m sorry
for the trouble this error caused you.
I&#8217;ll report again after confirmation of these repositories.
csv and soap libraries which are bundled to ruby&#8217;s repository(/src/ruby)
were confirmed that it is safe.</p>

  <p>lib/soap4r, lib/csv, mod_ruby-old were added to the Anonymous <span class="caps">CVS</span> repository.
Then, eruby was renamed to eruby-old.
mod_ruby/eruby are developed on the Subversion repository now.</p>

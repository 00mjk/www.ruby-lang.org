  <h3><a href="/en/news/2002/10/24/raa-replaced/">RAA replaced</a></h3>

  <p>We www-admin@ruby-lang.org rewrote current <a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/"><span class="caps">RAA</span></a> which got a little old and rickety.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>lightweight top page</li>
<li>iso8859-1 =&gt; <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8</li>
<li>added simple keyword search</li>
<li>show projects by the specified owner</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">XML</span>-RPC interfaces will be updated, too. Users of <span class="caps">RAA SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">XML</span>-RPC interfaces, please tell me if the problem occurred.  I changed wire format a little.  See below;</p>
<ul>
<li>id and owner_id element are added to each entry.
Those two elements contain positive integer.</li>
<li>For <span class="caps">SOAP</span> interface users only: element url, download
and email are marked as xsd:anyURI type.  Those
elements will be unmarshalled as a <span class="caps">URI</span> object at
client side, not a String object.</li>
</ul>
<p>Except <span class="caps">SOAP</span> and <span class="caps">XML</span>-RPC we are offering a plain <span class="caps">XML</span> or <span class="caps">RDF</span> file of <span class="caps">RAA</span> information.  Those are at http://raa.ruby-lang.org/xml.xml and http://raa.ruby-lang.org/rdf.xml.  You can also get recent information in <span class="caps">RDF</span> format from http://raa.ruby-lang.org/since.mrb</p>
<p>Users of pragdave&#8217;s <span class="caps">XML</span>/RDF feed interfaces should use above for a while.  Pragdave&#8217;s former interfaces are not updated now because of replacing <span class="caps">RAA DB</span>.  Bare in mind some changes are made to these interfaces, too.  See below;</p>
<ul>
<li>*.xml files are updated in each 15 minutes, not on the
fly.</li>
<li>Charset encoding scheme was changed from iso-8859-1 to
<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8.</li>
<li>
<span class="caps">XML</span> instance format is changed for user&#8217;s convenience.</li>
</ul>

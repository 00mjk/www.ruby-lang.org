_These are the posting guidelines for comp.lang.ruby,
adopted from the [comp.lang.ruby FAQ][clrFAQ]._

You should also follow these guidelines for the ruby-list mail list,
since it is mirrored to comp.lang.ruby.

1. ALWAYS be friendly, considerate, tactful, and tasteful. We want to
   keep this forum hospitable to the growing ranks of newbies, very
   young people, and their teachers, as well as cater to fire breathing
   wizards. :-)

2. Keep your content relevant and easy to follow. Try to keep your
   content brief and to the point, but also try to include all relevant
   information.

   1. The general format guidelines (aka USENET Netiquette) are
      matters of common sense and common courtesy that make life
      easier for 3rd parties to follow along (in real time or when
      perusing archives):

      * PLEASE NOTE! Include quoted text from previous posts
        **before** your responses. And **selectively** quote as much
        as is relevant.
      * Use **plain** text; don't use HTML, RTF, or Word. Most mail
        or newsreader programs have an option for this; if yours
        doesn't, get a (freeware) program or use a web-based
        service that does.
      * Include examples from files as **in-line** text; don't use
        attachments.

   2. If reporting a problem, give **all** the relevant information
      the first time; this isn't the psychic friends newsgroup. :-)

      When appropriate, include:

      * The version of Ruby. (`ruby -v`)
      * The compiler name and version used to build Ruby.
      * The OS type and level. (`uname -a`)
      * The actual error messages.
      * An example (preferably simple) that produces the problem.

3. Make the subject line maximally informative, so that people who
   should be interested will read your post and so that people who
   wouldn't be interested can easily avoid it.

   **Usefully** describe the contents of your post.

   This is OK:

   * "How can I do x with y on z?"
   * "Problem: did x, expected y, got z."
   * "BUG: doing x with module y crashed z."

   This is **not** OK:

   * "Please help!!!"
   * "Newbie question"
   * "Need Ruby guru to tell me what's wrong"

   These prefixes have become common for subject lines:

   * `[ANN]` (for announcements)
   * `[BUG]` (for bug reports)
   * `[OT]`  (for off-topic, if you must post off-topic)

4. Finally, be considerate: Don't be too lazy. If you are seeking
   information, first make a reasonable effort to look it up. As
   appropriate, check the Ruby home page, check the Ruby FAQ and other
   documentation, use google.com to search past comp.lang.ruby
   postings, and so on.

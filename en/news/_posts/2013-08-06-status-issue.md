Some services provided by ruby-lang.org are stopped,
because the servers of ruby-lang.org are currently down.

Impact is as follows:

 * All mailing lists provided by ruby-lang.org are down.
 * Ruby's tar packages distributed by ftp.ruby-lang.org are unreachable.
 * If you lookup old DNS cache, you cannot reach www.ruby-lang.org.

We are repairing these services now.

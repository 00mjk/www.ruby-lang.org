  <p>The first <a href="http://jaoo.dk/ruby-cph/conference/">Ruby Fools conference</a> will be held on April Fools&#8217; Day in Copenhagen, Denmark.  The conference organizers intend to cater a bit to both expert and novice developers, so any Rubyists in the area may want to consider attending.</p>

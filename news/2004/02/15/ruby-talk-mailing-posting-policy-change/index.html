title: Ruby-talk Mailing Posting Policy Change
---

<p>The ruby-talk mailing has changed its posting policy. The list now requires one to be a member before posting a message.  This is a change from the previous &#8220;anyone may post&#8221; policy.
If you&#8217;ve sent some recent list messages, but have not seen them on the list, check if you&#8217;re using an appropriate &#8220;from&#8221; address, and look for any automated list admin messages coming back.</p>

November 15th, but they will accept the late entries from the U.S.
specially up until the end of this month(11/30). There aren’t many
applicants at this point (less than 10). Which means you have a very

  <h3><a href="/en/news/2010/10/01/see-matz-in-san-francisco-or-silicon-valley/">See Matz in San Francisco or Silicon Valley</a></h3>

  <p>Matz is visiting San Francisco and Silicon Vally on October 7th and 11th. He will be talking about new opportunities for Ruby such as embedded applications, cloud computing, and super computing. Keynote Speech is “Ruby 2.0 What we want to accomplish in the near future.” Not only Matz but some cool startups from Fukuoka, Japan will give a demo on some of their latest developments using Ruby. For more info, please go to <a href="http://investfk.com/">http://investfk.com/</a>.</p>

    <p>By the way, the reason why Matz is coming with startups from Fukuoka is Fukuoka is the only prefecture that has governmental Ruby committee in Japan. Fukuoka is one of the most enthusiastic city in Japan in terms of Ruby.</p>

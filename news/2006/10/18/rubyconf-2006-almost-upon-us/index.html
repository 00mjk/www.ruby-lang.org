---

<p>With people traveling from all over the world, <a href="http://mokolabs.com/2006/09/08/the-rubyconf-express/">by train</a>, by car, and by air, enthusiasm is building for <a href="http://rubyconf.org/">RubyConf 2006</a>! The conference is scheduled to begin Friday morning, but if you arrive early you may be able to join in on a few preliminary activities.</p>
<div id="extended">
<p>There are over <a href="http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/agenda.html">16 talks scheduled</a> with topics ranging from <em>Leveraging Mac <span class="caps">OS X</span> from Ruby</em> to <em><span class="caps">YARV</span> on Rails</em>. There&#8217;s even a talk on <em>Natural Language Processing in Ruby</em> and one on the development of Iron Mongrel (the hot new Web server written in Ruby). Check out the <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org/agenda_detail.html">talk descriptions</a> for the gory details.</p>

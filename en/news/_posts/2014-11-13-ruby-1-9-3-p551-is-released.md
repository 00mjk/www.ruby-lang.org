We are pleased to announce the release of Ruby 1.9.3-p551.

This release includes a security fix for DoS vulnerability of REXML.
It is similar to [the fixed vulnerability](/en/news/2014/10/27/rexml-dos-cve-2014-8080/) in [the previous release](/en/news/2014/10/27/ruby-2-0-0-p594-is-released/), but this handles another case for entity expansion.
Please look the topic below for more details.

* [CVE-2014-8090: Another Denial Of Service XML Expansion](/en/news/2014/11/13/rexml-dos-cve-2014-8090/)


## Notice

Ruby 1.9.3 is now in the security maintenance phase.
This means that we never fix bugs except for security issues.
And, at this time, the end of the maintenance of 1.9.3 has been scheduled for February next year.
We recommend that users of ruby 1.9.3 should migrate to a newer version as soon as possible.

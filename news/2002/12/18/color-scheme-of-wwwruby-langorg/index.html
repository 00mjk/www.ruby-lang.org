title: Color scheme of www.ruby-lang.org
---

<p>We webmasters decided to change the red only color scheme of this site following a recommendation in 
<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/59202">[ruby-talk:59202]</a>.</p>
<p>
You may see somewhat strange color scheme while our <span class="caps">CSS</span>
development.
Thank you for your kind corporation.</p>
<p>And we also thank people who are discussing about color scheme
on ruby-talk. </p>

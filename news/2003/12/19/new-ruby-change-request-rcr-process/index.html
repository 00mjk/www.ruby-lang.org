title: New Ruby Change Request (RCR) process
---

<p>In <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/88503">[ruby-talk:88503]</a>, David Alan Black announced the launch of the new official process for RCRs.  The new process is the result of matz&#8217;s desire to further formalize the process, as expressed in his <a href="http://www.rubyconf.org">RubyConf 2003</a> <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/%7Ematz/slides/rc2003">presentation</a>.</p>


	<p>The new site for Ruby Change Requests is <a href="http://rcrchive.net">rcrchive.net</a>.</p>


	<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://pragprog.com/pragdave">Dave Thomas</a>, who facilitated the creation of the <span class="caps">RCR</span> process 3 years ago.</p>

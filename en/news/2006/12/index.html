  <p>We have moved the source code repository to <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/">http://svn.ruby-lang.org/repos/ruby/</a>.
You can checkout it using the svn command, or you can also browse it by <a href="http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?root=ruby">ViewVC</a>.</p>
<p>The new machine for svn.ruby-lang.org is provided by <a href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>.
We are using <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris 10</a> on the new machine, and it works pretty well.</p>

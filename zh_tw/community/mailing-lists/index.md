Mailing-lists are a great way to keep your finger on the pulse of the
Ruby community. Ruby has four primary English speaking mailing lists:

Ruby-Talk
: This is the most popular mailing-list and deals with general topics
  about Ruby. Ruby-Talk is mirrored by the
  [comp.lang.ruby](news:comp.lang.ruby) newsgroup and
  [Ruby-Forum.com][1]. ([Weekly Summaries][2], [FAQ][3], [Archives][4])

Ruby-Core
: This list deals with core and implementation topics about Ruby, often
  used to run patches for review. ([Archives][5])

Ruby-Doc
: This list is for discussing documentation standards and tools for
  Ruby. ([Archives at Gmane][6])

Ruby-CVS
: This list reports all commits to Ruby’s CVS repository.

title: Pragmatic Bookshelf planning a series of Ruby books
---

<p>&#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221; author Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers announced plans for a series of Ruby books from the Pragmatic Bookshelf (the Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; own imprint).  &#8220;The intent is to create a series of books with a deeply practical focus. We won&#8217;t
just document APIs. Instead, we want to show how to get <em>value</em> from those APIs&#8212;-how to solve real-world problems.&#8221;</p>

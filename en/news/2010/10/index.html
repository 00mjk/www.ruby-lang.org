Keynote Speech is &#8220;Ruby 2.0 What we want to accomplish in the near future.&#8221; Not only Matz but some cool startups from Fukuoka, Japan will give a demo on some of their latest developments using Ruby.

	<p>By the way, the reason why Matz is coming with startups from Fukuoka is Fukuoka is the only prefecture that has governmental Ruby committee in Japan. Fukuoka is one of the most enthusiastic city in Japan in terms of Ruby.</p>

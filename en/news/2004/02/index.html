  <p>The March issue of <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=NS-lj-issues/issue119&amp;file=index">Linux Journal</a>   has an article by James Britt on manipulating OpenOffice.org documents using Ruby.  
Please note that the article has at least one error:  James, who, honestly, really does know better, incorrectly attributed <span class="caps">REXML</span>.  The creator/owner of <span class="caps">REXML</span> is Sean Russell.</p>

  <p>The ruby-talk mailing has changed its posting policy. The list now requires one to be a member before posting a message.  This is a change from the previous &#8220;anyone may post&#8221; policy.
If you&#8217;ve sent some recent list messages, but have not seen them on the list, check if you&#8217;re using an appropriate &#8220;from&#8221; address, and look for any automated list admin messages coming back.</p>

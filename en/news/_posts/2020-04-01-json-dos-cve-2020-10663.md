There is unsafe object creation vulnerability in the json bundled with ruby. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier [CVE-2020-10663](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-10663). We strongly recommend to upgrade JSON gem.

## Details

When parsing certain JSON documents, the JSON gem (includes bundled with ruby) can be coerced in to creating arbitrary object in a target system.

This is the same issue as [CVE-2013-0269](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/).  The previous fix was incomplete, which addressed `JSON.parse(user_input)`, but didn't address some other styles of JSON parsing including `JSON(user_input)` and `JSON.parse(user_input, nil)`.

See [CVE-2013-0269](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/22/json-dos-cve-2013-0269/) in detail.  Note that the issue was exploitable to cause a Denial of Service by creating many garbage-uncollectable Symbol objects, but this kind of attack is no longer valid because Symbol objects are now garbage-collectable.  However, creating arbitrary object may cause fatal consequence depending upon the application code.

Please update json gem 2.3.0 or later.  You can use `gem update json` to update it.  If you are using bundler, please add `gem "json", ">= 2.3.0"` to your `Gemfile`.

## Affected versions

* JSON gem 2.2.0 or prior

<p>Here on the Ruby Garden Wiki comes <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyIn2002">a page</a> to compile Ruby&#8217;s year 2002 and plans on 2003. The deadline is January 9.
RubyIn2002 <a href="http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyIn2002">http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyIn2002</a>
This page supports a following plan: &#8220;The Year in Scripting Languages(Lua/Perl/Python/Ruby/Tcl)&#8221;. The aim of that is to encourage these scripting language communities to collaborate with each other; its first step is to know neighbors, which will lead us to be able to share our efforts on scriptings. The chair person is Mitchell N. Charity.

We stopped Mailing list on ruby-lang.org temporary.

Our mailing lists were atacked by spam bomb. We stopped following lists:

 * ruby-core
 * ruby-talk
 * ruby-dev
 * ruby-list
 * ruby-cvs
 * ruby-doc
 * ruby-ext
 * ruby-fr
 * ruby-math

We work to resume these lists as soon as we can.

I'm sorry for your inconvenient experience.

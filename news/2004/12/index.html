  <h3><a href="/en/news/2004/12/19/pragmatic-bookshelf-planning-a-series-of-ruby-books/">Pragmatic Bookshelf planning a series of Ruby books</a></h3>

  <p>&#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221; author Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers announced plans for a series of Ruby books from the Pragmatic Bookshelf (the Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; own imprint).  &#8220;The intent is to create a series of books with a deeply practical focus. We won&#8217;t
just document APIs. Instead, we want to show how to get <em>value</em> from those APIs&#8212;-how to solve real-world problems.&#8221;</p>


	<p>See <a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/123137">the full announcement</a> for more information, including follow-up guidelines for potential authors.</p>

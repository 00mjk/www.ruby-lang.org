We decided to suspend raa.ruby-lang.org (also known as
"Ruby Application Archive").
We have no server or human resources to continue hosting raa.ruby-lang.org.
If you still need to browse raa.ruby-lang.org, please visit
http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://raa.ruby-lang.org/.

"Ruby Application Archive" was first started in 1997.
It moved to raa.ruby-lang.org in 2003 and introduced a lot of
useful libraries to Rubyists.
Please use http://rubygems.org and http://www.ruby-toolbox.com instead.
Thanks.

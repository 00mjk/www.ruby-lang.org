www.ruby-lang.org reloaded
==========================

This is the official port of the
[www.ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) website to
[Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/). You can view the live preview
at [ruby-lang.github.io](http://ruby-lang.github.io/).

Right now, [we](https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/wiki/Team) are in the middle of the transition from the
current RadiantCMS-based website to this Jekyll-based site.

## How to Contribute?

You can contribute by comparing
[ruby-lang.github.io](http://ruby-lang.github.io/)
to [www.ruby-lang.org](http://www.ruby-lang.org/)
and reporting any inconsistencies between the two sites.

Changes of the content (corrections, improvements, â€¦) and the design
will have to wait until after the migration!

Further details about contributing are [available in the wiki](https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org/wiki).

## Get It!

In order to preview your changes to the website, you need to have
[Jekyll and Pygments installed](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/install)
on your local system.

Clone the repository, create the site and start a local server:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org.git
cd www.ruby-lang.org/
bundle install
rake preview # you may need to use bundle exec
```

Then, open [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser.

Note that creating the website may take several minutes.

To create the website *without starting a local server*, use:

```
rake generate
```

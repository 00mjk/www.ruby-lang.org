<p> RAA is upgraded.</p>
<p>Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="caps">URL</span> was changed.  <span class="caps">RAA</span> is at
<a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/">http://raa.ruby-lang.org/</a>
now.  Former <span class="caps">URL</span> http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/raa.html
is redirected to the new <span class="caps">URL</span>.</li>
<li>Add new page &#8220;All&#8221; that lists all <span class="caps">RAA</span> entries by
alphabetical order.</li>
<li>Show number of projects in each major_category or
minor category in listing view.  We have 753 projects
now.  Is your stomach full?</li>
<li>Add <span class="caps">AND</span>/OR search option.  <span class="caps">RAA</span> search is substring
search, not a word search.</li>
<li>Project&#8217;s &#8220;name&#8221; field is restricted to match
/\A[a-z0-9_-]{2,15}\z/ .
<ul>
<li>
<span class="caps">RAA</span> users can refer a project with a simple name like
&#8220;druby&#8221;.  They don&#8217;t have to remember the ID number or
a long name like &#8220;druby &#8211; distributed ruby&#8221;.</li>
<li>Application owner must specify canonical name(s)
of his/her project(s).</li>
</ul>
This field is a freezed (static, const) field.
For each existing entries, I prepared a canonical name
created from former name, Project <span class="caps">UNIX</span> Name in
sourceforge or filename of its download item.  See
<a href="http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/58018">[ruby-talk:58018]</a> for your entry.
Since I created canonical names automatically with
a script<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, some owners would think that it isn&#8217;t
a suitable name for their project.
So <span class="caps">UNTIL THE END OF THIS</span> <acronym title="2002">YEAR</acronym> owner can change
this &#8220;name&#8221; field of his/her entry.  </li>
<li>Add new field &#8220;short description&#8221;.
Owners can describe short(63 bytes or shorter)
description here.
At now, this field is filled with former &#8220;name&#8221; field.
Feel free to change this field anytime.</li>
<li>To add an application entry, you must type pass phrase
twice.  Don&#8217;t forget your pass phrase.</li>

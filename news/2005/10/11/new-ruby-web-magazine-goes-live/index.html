---

<p>The newest on-line resource for serious Ruby information has gone live.  
<a href="http://www.artima.com/rubycs/index.html">Ruby Code &amp; Style</a>, an on-line magazine from <a href="http://www.artima.com">Artima</a>, has just published issue #1.
Check out the names on the advisory board. It&#8217;s a Who&#8217;s Who of everybody who&#8217;s anybody in the Ruby world.
The premiere issue has three outstanding articles:
First up, Jack Herrington, author of Code Generation in Action (Manning, 2002) and Podcasting Hacks (O&#8217;Reilly, 2005), has written <a href="http://www.artima.com/rubycs/articles/modular_apis_with_ruby.html">Modular Architectures with Ruby</a>
Next, Austin Ziegler gives us <a href="http://www.artima.com/rubycs/articles/pdf_writer.html">Creating Printable Documents with Ruby</a>
And there&#8217;s a reprint of Ara Howard&#8217;s article, <a href="http://www.artima.com/rubycs/articles/rubyqueue.html">Linux Clustering with Ruby Queue: Small is Beautiful</a>, which first appeared in Linux Journal but deserves repeat attention
A big thanks to the advisory board, and especial to Bill Venners for starting this whole thing.</p>
